        Other Worlds is a zine collective based in Australia. Every May we hold
        an annual zine fair in Sydney. We also run quarterly postal subscription
        service.

        Other Worlds has been collectively organised since 2014. We are a
        progressive organisation that hopes to provide a space for marginalised
        voices. We acknowledge that Other Worlds takes place on the stolen lands
        of the Gadigal and Wangal people of the Darug nation.

        loosely collected around a theme. There will be four packs in total.
      </p>

        The first pack drops in August 2020 and is titled “The City as Might
        Have Been”.

      <p class="mb-4">
        On the last Sunday of May we hold the Other Worlds Zine Fair in Sydney,
        Australia. Now in its 7th year, it attracts over 100 stall holders and
        200 attendees.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The zine fair was born out of the 2014 Biennale boycotts of Transfield
        (the service providers for Australia’s offshore immigration detention
        centres).
